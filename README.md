# belly-button-challenge

#### In this challenge built an interatcive dashboard to explore belly button biodiversity dataset.   The dataset will reveal that a small handful of microbial species (also called aperational taxaonomic units, or OTUS, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.   

#### Used the D3 library to read in samples.json from URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.  

#### The dasboard will contain a horizontal bar chare with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found within each individual.  

#### The dasborad will also contain a bubble chart displaying each sample.
